# Face_Morphing_Detection_Using_GAN
Implementation of a Face Morphing  Detection System using GAN architecture to identify and prevent image-based identity fraud.
## Problem Statement:

Face morphing attacks pose a major security risk in identity verification systems by blending facial features of two individuals to create deceptive images. These attacks exploit weaknesses in facial recognition systems, allowing unauthorized access. With advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), detecting such high-quality morphed images has become more challenging.
Traditional detection methods struggle against GAN-generated images, especially under varying conditions like lighting or resolution. GAN-based attacks can also outsmart simple models, necessitating robust detection systems that generalize well and perform in real-time.
To counter these threats, using GANs for both generating synthetic training data and improving detection accuracy is a promising approach. Integrating deep learning, explainable AI, and multi-modal biometric verification can boost system resilience. The ultimate goal is to build an adaptive, scalable, and efficient framework for real-world face morphing detection.
